Software is developed using Qt open source tools in Qt Creator and mainly using Qt 5.12.8.

Compiling software, you need atleast Qt 5.12.8 with Qt Charts and Qt Serial installed (if not installed
already with Qt) and project opened in Qt Creator. All other methods untested.

There is also precompiled versions for Windows 7 32/64bit and Linux.

How to install:
Download the FastECU zip package for your OS from github https://github.com/miikasyvanen/fastecu-oem/tree/master/precompiled
and unzip the files into a convenient folder.

How to use:
In main screen, with right COM-port selected (dropdown in right of toolbar) it will repeatedly send
init command to ECU to check ECU ID and possible log parameters. Using 'Play' button in toolbar or in 'Ecu' menu it will
start and stop logging. With 'Record' button it is possible to start saving log values to file when logging.

'Select vehicle' button opens dialog to select vehicle to read/write.

Green 'Down' arrow will read ROM from ECU, green 'Up' arrow will test write ROM to ECU and red 'Up' arrow will
write ROM to ECU. Car/ECU model should be selected prior read/write via toolbar 'Select vehicle' button.

For tuning, check 'Tune' menu for possible options and shorcuts. Also copy&paste will work in maps.

In lower log parameters area or in map view area, mouse right click opens window to change displayed log
parameters. "Gauge view" is not yet implemented in this version.

Tested flash methods:
- wrx02 method read and compare (K-Line)
- fxt02 method read/write (K-Line / Denso CAN)
- sti04 method read/write (K-Line / Denso CAN)
- sti05 method read/write (K-Line / Denso CAN)
- subarucan method read/write (iso15765 / Denso CAN)
- sub_sh7055_denso_can (All Subaru Denso 32-bit ECUs with SH7055/SH7058) read/write
- Logging of basic ssm values
- Read Subaru Unisia Jecs ECUs

Tested OBD adapters:
K-Line and CAN read and write succesfully tested - Open port 2.0 and generic OBD-cable (no CAN, FTDI chip, CH340) in Windows 7 64-bit and Linux.

Other notes:
This is basically test version for reading and writing ECUs. Many of the other options will NOT work yet. Development
of these options is on the way but due to my limited time, it will not be fast. Be patient! :)

All liability lies with the user. I am not responsible any harm, laws broken or bricked ECUs that can follow for using this software.

Things that not yet work:
- Undo / Redo
- Gauge view for logging
- Graph view for logging
- Possibility to use custom seeds / access methods
- Many other things that just don't come to mind right now
